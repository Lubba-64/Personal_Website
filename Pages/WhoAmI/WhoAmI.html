        In terms of what I want to accomplish with my life,<br>
        The thing I value most in life is doing something That matters.<br>
        it can be something I want, and it can be fun, but if it doesn't have an impact on me and my<br>
        future and the people around me in a big way I'm not interested. everything I do<br>
        is to move forward and make an impact, even if the impact is not immediately tangible.

        <p class="Paragraph">
        Most of the things I am interested in I am also good at doing. I have been working on video games<br>
        for the past 2 years, and I have gotten pretty good at video game programming and leading my team<br>
        in that period of time. I am still a huge novice when it comes to video editing and recording, <br>
        but I know my way around OBS and am planning on upgrading to davinci resolve at somepoint. I have<br>
        also made 3 PCs for friends and have taken up PC building as a hobby, but some day I might try to<br>
        do it in a commercial sense assuming nothing else I'm doing works out which is unlikely. also my<br>
        programming skill isn't just limited to games, as evidenced by some of my other projects. I just<br>
        like to apply my skills there because thats the most interesting thing to do with them at the moment.<br>

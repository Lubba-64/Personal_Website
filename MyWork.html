        Below I have a list of projects that I have completed and are publically available. <br>
        Note, that most of my projects aren't publically available, due to them being unfinished.<br>
        For example, I have 2 years of experience with unity development but only one public project (rent spent) to<br>
        show for it. There are two larger projects that are unfinished (with one of them set to release soon)<br>
        so take that into account.<br>

        All of the games I have made are under the umbrella of SoulShardStudios. Its just a group of game developers<br>
        coming together to make cool things. I am one of the founders and am the primary code contributor as well as project manager.<br>
        We have two unreleased projects - Pixels and ThrowEverything.<br>
        Either way here are some links to the SoulShard stuff<br>

        This was a game that I helped make for the black thorn prod gamejam, in one week.<br>
        There are a large number of things I could have done better but due to it being<br>
        a school week and the limited time frame, it wasn't completely polished. However, it<br>
        isn't terrible either and the other jam participants enjoyed playing it. <br>
        <br>
        It's essentially a game where you start with some items, and then proceed to try and find<br>
        the best trades to exchange what you have for more valuble items, all while trying to<br>
        pay off the ever increasing rent.<br>
        <br>
        You can play the game <a class="Link" href="https://soulshardstudios.itch.io/rent-spent" target="_blank">here</a> (windows only).<br>

        This was a fun little project that I cooked up just so I could learn javascript, typescript, HTML and CSS<br>
        It wasn't super hard, but it was complicated enough to merit around 1200 lines of code. Currently its missing<br>
        some features (COUGH castling) but overall its a fully functional version of chess that you can play in browser<br>
        with a friend. I will likely come back and add online multiplayer at some point when I need to learn websocket<br>
        but for now its finished and I'm moving on to other stuff. <br>

        I had to make this website for a school project so there's that. not much else to say other than that the majority of it got finished in two days.<br>
        You can view the source code <a class="Link" href="https://github.com/Lubba-64/Personal_Website" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
        (It's pretty lackluster considering the fact that this website is frontend only. the OpenSourceChess.com source code is way cooler)

        I had to make this for (you guessed it) a school project. took about three collective hours of my time, half of that was spent<br>
        rendering the fractals due to how SLOW Python/PYGame is. Either way it works and you can check out the source code <a class="Link" href="https://github.com/Lubba-64/MandelBrot.py" target="_blank">here</a>.

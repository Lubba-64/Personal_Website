        Below I have a list of projects that I have completed and are publically available. <br>
        Note that most of my projects aren't publically available, due to them being unfinished.<br>
        for example, I have 2 years of experience with unity development but only one public project (rent spent) to<br>
        show for it. there are two larger projects that are unfinished (with one of them set to release soon)<br>
        so take that into account.<br>

        all of the games I have made are under the umbrella of soulshardstudios. Its just a group of game developers<br>
        coming together to make cool things. we have two unreleased projects - pixels and throweverything.<br>
        either way here are some links to soulshard stuff:<br>

        This was a game that I helped make for the black thorn prod gamejam, in one week.<br>
        there are a large number of things I could have done better but due to it being<br>
        a school week and the limited time frame, it wasn't completely polished. however, it<br>
        isn't terrible either and some people enjoyed playing it. <br>
        <br>
        its essentially a game where you start with some items, and then proceed to try and find<br>
        the best trades to exchange what you have for more valuble items, all while trying to <br>
        pay off the ever increasing rent.<br>
        <br>
        you can play the game here (windows only) <a class="Link" href="https://soulshardstudios.itch.io/rent-spent" target="_blank">Game</a> <br>

        This was a fun little project that I cooked up just so I could learn javascript, typescript, HTML and CSS<br>
        it wasn't supr hard, but it was complicated enough to merit around 1200 lines of code. currently its missing<br>
        some features (COUGH castling) but overall its a fully functional version of chess that you can play in browser<br>
        with a friend. I will likely come back and add online multiplayer at some point when I need to learn websocket<br>
        but for now its finished and I'm moving on to other stuff. <br>
        you can play it here <a class="Link" href="https://lubba-64.github.io/OpenSourceChess/" target="_blank">OpenSourceChess.com</a><br>

        I had to make this website for a school project so there's that. not much else to say other than that the majority of it got finished in two days.<br>
        you can view the source code here <a class="Link" href="https://github.com/Lubba-64/Personal_Website" target="_blank">Source Code</a><br>
        (although its pretty lackluster considering the fact that this website is frontend only. the OpenSourceChess.com sourcecode is way cooler)

        I had to make this for (you guessed it) a school project. took about three collective hours of my time, half of that was spent<br>
        rendering the fractals due to how SLOW python/PYGame is. either way it works and you can check out the source code here
